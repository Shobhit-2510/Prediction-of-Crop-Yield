# Prediction of Crop Yield

* Yield prediction can be really helpful for farmers to predict their profit. We used Multivariable Linear regression to stablish relationship between temperature, rainfall and yield with other
environmental factors. Found outstanding correlation coefficient which clearly shows yield mainly
depends on temperature, rainfall.Research can be extended using more variables like food price
index (FPI), minimum support price (MSP).

* Provided Journal Article was our reference for making similiar Research Paper.
